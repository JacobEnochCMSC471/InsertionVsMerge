# InsertionVsMerge
Implementation and comparison of recursive Merge Sort and Insertion Sort in Python. Implementation is based off of CLRS pseudocode, found in the Divide and Conquer section of the textbook. MatPlotLib is used to plot the sorting times of these algorithms, given differently sized and randomly populated arrays.
